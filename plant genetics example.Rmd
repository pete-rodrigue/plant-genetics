## Introduction

This code simulates (in a very simplified way) the spread of seeds and plants between fragmented "islands" of habitat. The goal is to see how varying distance between islands changes plant genetics in later generations, similar to Williams, Kendall, and Levine (2016).

Those authors look at the spread of Arabidopsis thaliana, or Mouse-Ear Cress, which is native to Eurasia (and part of the Brassicaceae family, like cabbage or mustard).

!["Arabidopsis thaliana"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Arabidopsis_thaliana.jpg)


The code initializes a first generation, then allows seeds to spread to the right (and only to the right) a certain distance defined by the absolute value of random normal values. To survive, the seeds must land in a "pot" (a hospitable island). There are 3 pots. The first generation starts "off-screen," to the left of the three pots.

The user can change:

* The initial plant population size
* The distance between the pots (the input value is a function of the standard deviation of the seed-travel-distance distribution)
* Whether or not each generation of plants faces a "drought" which kills plants with a "drought tolerance" gene value below .25. There are 4 genes: "drought_tolerance", "predator_defense", "stalk_height", and "seed_fluffyness"--their values are randomly determined but sum to one (this implies some tradeoff between the genes).


Questions to consider:

* How might including pollination, not just seed dispersal, change what happens?
* What do you notice about how the "genetic diversity" in the last pot changes in the last few generations?
* What important dynamics are left out of this simulation?
* If a gene vanishes from a line of plants, this simulation doesn't let that gene reappear later. How might that (potentially unrealistic) assumption impact what happen?
* Do you find these simulations believable? Why or why not?
* Can you think of any policy implications?

This code proceeds in two sections: 

1. The functions used to run the simulations
2. The script that calls those functions to run the simulations and create summary graphs

## Script


#### Just one simulation, no drought:

```{r}
set.seed(983488)

results <- run_5_generations(pot_dist_quantile = .85, drought_list = rep(F, 4), num_seeds = 5, num_initial_plants = 20)
df <- results[[1]]
pot_gap <- results[[2]]
```


The plant's seed dispersal patterns look something like this:

```{r, fig.width=18, fig.height=10}
hist(
  abs(rnorm(n=10000, 
          mean = df$position[1],
          sd = 3*df$stalk_height[1] + .3*df$seed_fluffyness[1])),
  main="distribution of seed-travel distances", xlab="distance")
```

Note that the seeds only spread to the right, and they're more likely to land near the plant than farther away.

This first simulation places the pots relatively far away from each other. You'll see that in the last pot (pot 3) in the final two generations is mostly full of plants with tall stalks (i.e. "stalk_height" is the dominant gene). There is, however, slightly more genetic diversity (and a larger population size) in the final generation in pot 3, relative to the penultimate generation in pot 3. The dispersal front of plants with different dominant genes ("predator_defense" in this case) start to catch up to the speedy, stalk-height disperal front. 

The first plot below shows the sum of the genes in each pot (1, 2, or 3) in each generation (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).

The second plot shows the plants as dots, colored by their dominant gene. The pots are represented by the vertical black lines.

The third plot again shows each individual plant in each generation, but now shows the actual genetic makeup, represented using pie charts.

The last chart shows the mean gene value in each generation and pot, effectively showing us what the "average" plant looks like.

Here are the plots:

```{r, fig.width=18, fig.height=10}
make_plots(df, pot_gap)
```


#### Just one simulation, with a drought:

Now we will run a simulation where the pots are still far apart (more fragmented landscape), but a drought occurs in the final generation, killing all plants with a value of the "drought tolerance" gene less than .25. 


```{r}
set.seed(983488)

results <- run_5_generations(pot_dist_quantile = .85, drought_list = c(F, F, F, T), num_seeds = 5, num_initial_plants = 20)
df <- results[[1]]
pot_gap <- results[[2]]
```

Note that things look similar to the last simulation, except for the last generation, where all of the plants in pot 3 die, because they're focused on stalk height, and do not have sufficient drought tolerance to survive the drought.

```{r, fig.width=18, fig.height=10}
make_plots(df, pot_gap)
```


#### Moving the plots closer together:

In this simulation we move the pots closer together. Note that this simulation results in greater genetic diversity in the pot 3 in generation 5, and a greater number of plants in general.

```{r}
set.seed(983488)

results <- run_5_generations(pot_dist_quantile = .4, drought_list = c(F, F, F, F), num_seeds = 5, num_initial_plants = 20)
df <- results[[1]]
pot_gap <- results[[2]]
```

Plots:

```{r, fig.width=18, fig.height=10}
make_plots(df, pot_gap)
```

#### Distribution of simulation results

Now we will iterate over these simulations many times, to get a distribution of results.

```{r, warning=F}

num_iters <- 500

results1 <- simulate_many_worlds(iter_pot_dist_quantile=.85, 
                                iter_drought_list=c(F, F, F, F),

Note that the drought limits the number of plants, as we might expect, but so does the landscape fragmentation. The second figure shows that the fragmentation and drought also change the genetic makeup of the plant population.
